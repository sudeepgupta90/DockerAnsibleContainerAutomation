This project aims to remove the entry barrier to developing for Ansible. This project allows you to create a network of dockr containers with pre-configured hosts lookup and passwordless ssh login to jumpstart your development of Ansible codes.

The python script does the following:-
-> create a subnet on docker "bridge" network
-> launch containers on the new subnet
-> the containers have been pre-built with a ssh key, so it allows passwordless login
-> the subnet allows the docker containers with automatic host lookups (hurray!), and communication is open on all ports within the subnet
-> to allow deployment of ansible playbooks/roles
	- you have to bind the container to the directory which contains ansible code
	- a hosts file is automatically generated in the directory where the python script is placed
	- you then login to the ansiblehost container for which the command is generated as well, and begin developing with ansible
