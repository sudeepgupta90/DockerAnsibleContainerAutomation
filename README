This project aims to remove the entry barrier to developing for Ansible. This project allows you to create a network of docker containers with pre-configured hosts lookup and passwordless ssh login to jumpstart your development of Ansible codes.

The python script does the following:-
    • create a subnet on docker "bridge" network
    • launch containers on the new subnet
    • the containers have been pre-built with a ssh key, so it allows passwordless login
    • the subnet allows the docker containers with automatic host lookups (hurray!), and communication is open on all ports within the subnet
    • to allow deployment of ansible playbooks/roles
            - you have to bind the container to the directory which contains ansible code
            - a hosts file is automatically generated in the directory where the python script is placed
            - you then login to the ansiblehost container for which the command is generated as well, and begin developing with ansible

The script takes as arguments two command line options:
	--setup (int) number of host container you want to launch
	--cleanup will perform cleanup

To use the script, first place the script in some folder where you want to develop with ansible. The script automatically creates a folder named “ansible” for you to start developing later when you setup.
